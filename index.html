            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Angela Petrone. I am a 4th year Digital Humanities major at Illinois Institute of Technology.
               I am an international student from Italy, who moved to Chicago in 2021.  <br>
               I currently serve as the Editor-in-Chief of TechNews, a Technical Writer for the Office of Technology Services at Illinois Tech,
               and a Computer Science and Information Technology Supplemental Instructor for CS100-300 and ITMD362 (Human-Computer Interaction).
               <br>
               I specialize in Philosophy and Game Design. As part of my coursework I build games and digital experiences, as well as conduct research on the ethics of information science.
               I am always working towards my career goal: to work in tech as a human-centered designer.
